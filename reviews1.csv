review
"I always wanted to experience a curved display flagship smartphone by Samsung, hence ignored the S24 Ultra and bought the S23 Ultra because it's the last curved display phone by Samsung."
"After using Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra for quite a bit as a daily driver and coming back to Samsung after a long time after using other smaller form factor phones like ONEPLUS 9, here's what I think about this phone"
Good value for money. Will buy again.
